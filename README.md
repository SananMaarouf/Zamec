## Features

- Composable content through powerful & flexible content modeling.
- Localization ready.
- SEO ready.
- Incremental Static Regeneration with Next.js[^1].
- Generation of GraphQL[^2] typed code (schema, and types), in sync with the content types through graphql-codegen[^3].
- Enhanced Developer Experience with TypeScript[^4].

## Getting started

To get started, read the following guidelines.

- [Environment variables](./README.md#environment-variables)
- [Dependencies](./README.md#dependencies)
- [Development](./README.md#development)
- [Contentful API & GraphQL](./README.md#contentful-api--graphql)
- [Deployment](./README.md#deployment)

$~$

### Environment variables

In order to authenticate the requests to the Contentful APIs, the following values are necessary:

- Your space ID: [https://www.contentful.com/help/find-space-id/](https://www.contentful.com/help/find-space-id/)
- Contentful Delivery API token: [https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/)
- Contentful Preview API token: [https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/)

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add the necessary values.

$~$

### Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn
```

### Run the Starter Template in development mode

```bash
yarn dev
```

It should be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.

All necessary dependencies are installed under `node_modules` and any necessary tools can be accessed via npm scripts.

### Contentful API & GraphQL

This project makes use of Contentful's [GraphQL API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/graphql/).

API calls made to the Contentful GraphQL endpoint are made through `graphql-request`.

The types are generated from the `.graphql` files located in the `/lib/graphql/` directory:

1. `lib/graphql/[fileName].graphql` is detected by the [codegen](./README.md#graphql--code-generation)
2. `lib/__generated/sdk.ts` is generated
3. Within the generated file, their types and a new `getSdk` function are generated
4. The `getSdk` function can now be imported and used within the `getStaticProps` in the pages files

$~$

### GraphQL & code generation

We use `graphql-codegen` to generate a type-safe API client, utilizing [GraphQLClient](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript/typescript-graphql-request) as the "client".

---

#### Commands

In order to (re-)generate the GraphQL schema, types and sdk, please use either of the following commands:

- `yarn graphql-codegen:generate` generates a schema, types and code to fetch data from the Contentful APIs
- `yarn graphql-codegen:watch` similar to the `generate` command, but it runs as a watch task which will rerun the steps when changes are made in the `.graphql` files

The first steps of the codegen generate files that contain the GraphQL schema and matching TypeScript types. All these files are located in the `src/lib/graphql` folder.
They're generated to the `src/lib/__generated` folder and ought to be committed once altered/added to the repository.

The TS types for these files are generated in the same location, in a `__generated` folder and like the other files ought to be committed.

---

#### Configuration

The configuration for the codegen can be found in `codegen.ts`, located in the root of the project.
